    "We wish to match cash obligations over a 6-year period. We select 10 bonds for this purpose (and for simplicity all accounting is done on a yearly basis). The cash flow structure of each bond is shown in the corresponding column in table 5.3. Below this column is the bondâ€™s current price. For example, the first column represents a $10\\%$ bond that matures in 6 years. This bond is selling at 109. The last column shows the yearly cash requirements (or obligations) for cash to be generated by the portfolio."

    "To formulate this problem mathematically, it is necessary to establish a basic time period lenght with a casho flow ocurring at the end of these periods. Each bond has an associated cashflow stream of receipts staring one period from now. If there are $m$ bonds, the stream associated with one unit of bond $j$ is denoted by $C_j=(c_{1j},c_{2j},...,c_{mj})$ The price of bond $j$ is denoted by $p_j$, the amount of bond $j$ held in the portfolio is denoted by $x_j$. Therefore, the cash matching problem is so to find the $x_j$'s of minimum total cost that guarantee that the obligations $y_i$ can be met. Formally, the problem can be expressed in the following form:\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective function to be minimized is the total cost of the portfolio, which is equal to the sum of the prices of the bonds times the amounts purchased. The main set of constraints are the cash matching constraints. For a given i the corresponding constraint states that the total amount of cash generated in period $i$ from all $m$ bonds must be at least equal to the obligation in period $i$. The final constraint rules out the possibility of selling bonds short."
